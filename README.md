While hyStrath mentions a [`2112` branch](https://www.openfoam.com/news/main-news/openfoam-v2112), that branch is nowhere to be found.
Getting the current version to work is a pain, especially on ARM.
This repository has a `Dockerfile` and a modified version of hyStrath's bash installation script which you can use to build a Docker image with the hyStrath `master` branch.
It uses OpenFOAM-v1706.
